# History Management Guide

Learn how to effectively manage, search, and reuse your enhanced prompts with Promptify's powerful history system.

## üìö Overview

Promptify automatically saves every enhanced prompt to your local history (unless disabled), creating a valuable library of effective prompts you can reuse and reference.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Saving**: Every enhancement is saved by default
- **Local Storage**: All data stays on your machine via Raycast's LocalStorage
- **Rich Search**: Find prompts by content, preset type, or date
- **Export Options**: Individual or bulk export in JSON format
- **Smart Organization**: Chronological with metadata tracking

## üéØ Accessing History

### Open History Command
1. **Via Raycast**: Type "History" and press Enter
2. **Via Keyboard**: Set a custom shortcut (recommended: `‚åò + Shift + H`)

### History Interface

The history view shows:
- **Original Text**: Your input prompt (truncated if long)
- **Preset Type**: General, Images, or Code with icons
- **Timestamp**: "5m ago", "2h ago", "3d ago" format
- **Character Count**: Length of enhanced output
- **Quick Actions**: Copy, paste, export, delete

## üîç Search and Filter

### Search Functionality
```
Search by:
- Original prompt text
- Enhanced output content  
- Preset type (general, images, code)
- Date range (coming in future updates)
```

### Search Tips
- **Partial Matches**: Search for "react" finds all React-related prompts
- **Case Insensitive**: "REACT", "react", "React" all work the same
- **Multiple Terms**: "react typescript" finds prompts containing both terms

### Filter Examples
```
"blog" ‚Üí All blog-related prompts
"midjourney" ‚Üí All image generation prompts
"api" ‚Üí All API-related code prompts
"email campaign" ‚Üí All email marketing prompts
```

Include keywords in your original prompts:

‚ùå **Generic**: "Make an image"
‚úÖ **Tagged**: "Midjourney prompt: professional headshot for LinkedIn"

### Project Organization
Group related prompts by project:

```
Project: Mobile App Launch
- "App landing page copy" ‚Üí General
- "App store screenshots" ‚Üí Images  
- "API documentation" ‚Üí Code
```

### Workflow Templates
Save successful prompt patterns:

```
Template: Product Launch Email
1. "Email about [product] launch for [audience]"
2. Enhance with General preset
3. Use enhanced output as template
4. Modify specific details for each launch
```
